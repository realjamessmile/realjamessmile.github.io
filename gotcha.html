        CONGRATULATIONS. You just got hacked -- or, you would have if this wasn't just a test (you failed).
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't beat yourself up too much though (once or twice is enough), ads like the one you just clicked
        on are DESIGNED to entice.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, the ads on the previous page are facsimiles of REAL ADS that I have
        fallen for MYSELF. It does happen to the very best of us. (You can imagine my frustration: only two 
        months after losing $730 to bang-remover [dot] com, I fell victim to SPREAD PROSÂ® -- after 10
        orders, I still haven't seen hide nor hair of my promised screensaver).
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank God this was just a drill. You can have that sip of brandy now.
