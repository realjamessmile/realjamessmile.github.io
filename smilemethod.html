            "The Smile Method" (1st Edition), was first released in 1981, and has been Google-translated into over 30 languages. The First-Edition printing has gained status amongst collectors as a highly-sought treasure – given all but a few surviving copies were destroyed in Egg Harbor's 1984 "Pier And Dock and Wharf Flash-Fire".<br><br>

            This textbook tackles complex topics "from the ground up", backing up abstract theory with real-world anecdotes from Smile's fascinating life in Egg Harbor, NJ. Think you know what subtraction is? What about a computer? Wrong. James flips these ideas on their heads, constructing an entirely new system of thinking. Each page of "The Smile Method" takes you one step closer to becoming a certified cyber-guru.<br><br>

            This is truly "The Bible of Cyber"
            <br><i style= "font-weight:normal;">–  Robert Denim, "Palace of Lights OP-ed"</i><br><br>

            This new and improved 3rd edition breathes new life into the classic textbook with over 30 years of new industry jargon and personal anecdotes. It's so much better than the 1st edition that it appears the author completely skipped writing a 2nd edition, going straight to the 3rd.
