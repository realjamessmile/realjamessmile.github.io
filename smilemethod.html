            "The Smile Method (1st Edition)" has been Google-translated into over 30 languages. The book was released in 1981 to an overwhelming response from both critics and the general public (that is to say, it received overwhelming criticism).  Nearly 40 years later, the book's polarizing legacy serves as a reminder of its revolutionary and industry-disrupting ideas.

            The Smile Method tackles complex topics of computer science "from the ground up," supporting abstract theory with real-world anecdotes from Smile's fascinating life in Egg Harbor, NJ. Think you know what subtraction is? What about a computer? Wrong. James flips these ideas on their heads, constructing an entirely new system of thinking that, once fully grasped, will transform anyone, young or old, into a bona fide Cyber-guru.

            Heralded by many as "The Bible of Cyber", the first edition printing of The Smile Method has gained status amongst collectors as a highly-sought treasure. Only 100 were ever believed to be printed, and all but a few surviving copies met their tragic end in Egg Harbor's infamous 1984 "Pier and Dock and Wharf Flash-Fire." One copy is proudly kept by Smile himself, who displays the crown jewel in a padlocked glass case on his mantle. A plaque reads: "Break glass ONLY in case of cyber-emergency".

            This new and improved 3rd edition breathes new life into the classic textbook with over 30 years of new industry jargon and personal anecdotes. It's so much better than the 1st edition that it appears the author completely skipped writing a 2nd edition, going straight to the 3rd.
