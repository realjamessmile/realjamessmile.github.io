[ I do not own anything, I just made the icon pack ]




== Icons source: Windows 95 OSR2 


== Programs used:

IconScanner v2.2 [AloneWolfSoft] -- Fast icon search

Resource Hacker (console mode) [Angus Johnson] -- Extract all .ICOs
-- Btw, why there's no command to extract all icons from all files in the folder?


PaintDotNet v4.2 -- Graphic editor (for preview.png)
